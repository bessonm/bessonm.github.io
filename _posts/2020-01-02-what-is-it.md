title: What is it ?
---

Currently, Chutney aims to test deployed software in order to validate functional requirements.

Other usage such as security or performance testing might be considered in the future but not guaranteed (optimization or specific features needed).

Chutney is released as a standalone application including a test execution engine, 
a web front end, and an edition server to create and edit your scenarios, consult test reports, and define your environments and test data.

The test engine can also be used alone and driven by any other tool like a CLI or an IDE plugin.

Chutney scenarios are declarative. They provide functional requirements and technical details (needed for automation) in a single view. 

Those technical details are provided by generic Tasks such as: 
* HTTP
* SOAP
* AMQP
* MongoDB
* SQL
* JMS
* Kafka
* Selenium
* JSON
* XML
* etc.

Those Tasks are extensions and you can easily develop yours, even proprietary or non-generic one, and include them in your own release.

In addition, Chutney provide SpEL evaluation and extensible Functions in order to ease the use of managing scenario data like JSON path or Date comparison.
